📘 PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS DOCUMENT (PRD)
Product Name (Working)
ChartSense AI (You can rename later — name is not the product)

1. 🎯 Product Vision
ChartSense AI is an AI-powered chart interpretation tool that helps traders understand market structure, momentum, and strategy bias by analyzing screenshots of trading charts (e.g., TradingView).
The product acts as a decision-support assistant, not an automated trading bot.
“Upload your chart → Get trader-style reasoning.”

2. 🚨 Problem Statement
The Trader’s Problem
	•	Traders stare at charts for hours
	•	Bias & emotions distort decisions
	•	Indicators give signals but lack context
	•	Beginners don’t know which strategy fits which market
	•	Experienced traders still seek confirmation or contradiction
Existing Solutions Fail Because:
	•	Indicators are mechanical, not contextual
	•	Trading bots require raw data & execution access
	•	Most AI tools are either:
	•	Overpromising predictions, or
	•	Generic chatbots with no market intuition

3. ✅ Solution Overview
ChartSense AI:
	•	Accepts a chart screenshot
	•	Interprets visual market structure
	•	Explains:
	•	Current price behavior
	•	Market regime (trend / range / breakout)
	•	Suitable trading strategies
	•	Provides probabilistic bias, not certainty
Human remains in control. Always.

4. 👤 Target Users
Primary Users
	•	Retail stock traders
	•	Swing traders
	•	Technical-analysis-focused traders
Secondary Users
	•	Beginner traders (learning aid)
	•	Trading educators
	•	Content creators (chart explanations)

5. 🧠 Core Use Case Flow
User Journey
	•	User takes a screenshot from TradingView
	•	Pastes or uploads it to ChartSense AI
	•	AI analyzes the chart
	•	AI outputs:
	•	Market state
	•	Indicator interpretation
	•	Strategy suggestions
	•	Risk & invalidation notes

6. 🧩 Core Features (MVP)
6.1 Chart Upload & Processing
Requirements
	•	Accept PNG / JPG screenshots
	•	Drag & drop + copy-paste
	•	Auto-crop chart area
	•	Remove UI noise (sidebars, legends)

6.2 Visual Chart Understanding
AI must infer:
	•	Trend direction
	•	Higher highs / lower lows
	•	Consolidation vs expansion
	•	Breakout zones
	•	Indicator panels (RSI, MACD, Moving Averages)
⚠️ Important: AI does visual reasoning, not numerical OHLC extraction.

6.3 Market Regime Classification
AI classifies chart into one of:
	•	Trending (bullish / bearish)
	•	Range-bound
	•	Breakout / breakdown
	•	Volatile / indecisive

6.4 Strategy Recommendation Engine
Based on regime:
	•	Trend-following
	•	Pullback trading
	•	Range trading
	•	Breakout continuation
	•	Avoid-trading scenarios

6.5 Output Explanation (Critical)
Output must include:
	•	What is happening
	•	Why it matters
	•	What traders usually do
	•	When this view is invalid
Example format:
Market Structure:
- Higher highs & higher lows (bullish)

Momentum:
- Strong upward candles
- RSI near upper range (momentum intact)

Suggested Bias:
- Trend continuation favored

Preferred Strategy:
- Buy on pullbacks
- Avoid chasing breakouts

Invalidation:
- Daily close below support zone

The product will NOT:
	•	Place trades
	•	Predict future prices
	•	Give guaranteed buy/sell signals
	•	Act as financial advice
	•	Connect to broker APIs (MVP)
This protects you legally and technically.

But it wins only if you:
	•	Stay disciplined on scope
	•	Avoid prediction promises
	•	Focus on reasoning quality, not signals
